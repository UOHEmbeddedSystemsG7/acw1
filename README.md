# ACW

## Instructions to Run

- Extract files from .zip into acw folder
- Open up MPLABX or other desired IDE
- Open the acw folder as a project
- Import all files in the acw directory by right clicking source files and then import existing items.
- Connect the PIC18F45K22 board to your PC
- Open up CODEGRIP and connect the device using the program.
- Run the project and select the CODEGRIP tool which should have autogenerated

The project should then build successfully and be programmed into the board.

MPLABX auto-generated MakeFiles, using XC8 compiler.
